# A .NET Core 2.2 simple daemon console application calling Microsoft Graph with its own identity

[![Build status](https://identitydivision.visualstudio.com/IDDP/_apis/build/status/AAD%20Samples/.NET%20client%20samples/active-directory-dotnetcore-daemon-v2%20CI)](https://identitydivision.visualstudio.com/IDDP/_build/latest?definitionId=695)

## About this sample

### Overview

This sample application shows how to use the [Microsoft identity platform endpoint](http://aka.ms/aadv2) to access the data of Microsoft business customers in a long-running, non-interactive process.  It uses the [OAuth 2 client credentials grant](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow) to acquire an access token, which can be used to call the [Microsoft Graph](https://graph.microsoft.io) and access organizational data

The app is a .NET Core 2.1 Console application. It gets the list of users in an Azure AD tenant by using `Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) for .NET` to acquire a token.

## Scenario

The console application:

- gets a token from Azure AD in its own name (without a user)
- and then calls the Microsoft Graph /users endpoint to get the list of user, which it then displays (as Json blob)

For more information on the concepts used in this sample, be sure to read the [Microsoft identity platform endpoint client credentials protocol documentation](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-v2-protocols-oauth-client-creds).

- Developers who wish to gain good familiarity of programming for Microsoft Graph are advised to go through the [An introduction to Microsoft Graph for developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBbnpFdB92A) recorded session. 

> ### Daemon applications can use two forms of secrets to authenticate themselves with Azure AD:
>
> - **application secrets** (also named application password).
> - **certificates**.
>
> The first form (application secret) is treated in the next paragraphs.
> A variation of this sample using a **certificate** instead, is available at the end of this article in [Variation: daemon application using client credentials with certificates](#Variation-daemon-application-using-client-credentials-with-certificates)

## How to run this sample

To run this sample, you'll need:

- [Visual Studio 2017](https://aka.ms/vsdownload) or just the [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started)
- An Internet connection
- A Windows machine (necessary if you want to run the app on Windows)
- An OS X machine (necessary if you want to run the app on Mac)
- A Linux machine (necessary if you want to run the app on Linux)
- An Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant. For more information on how to get an Azure AD tenant, see [How to get an Azure AD tenant](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-howto-tenant/)
- A user account in your Azure AD tenant. This sample will not work with a Microsoft account (formerly Windows Live account). Therefore, if you signed in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with a Microsoft account and have never created a user account in your directory before, you need to do that now.

### Step 1:  Clone or download this repository

From your shell or command line:

```Shell
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnetcore-daemon-v2.git
```

Go to the `"1-Call-MSGraph"` folder

```Shell
cd "1-Call-MSGraph"
```

or download and extract the repository .zip file.

> Given that the name of the sample is pretty long, and so are the name of the referenced NuGet packages, you might want to clone it in a folder close to the root of your hard drive, to avoid file size limitations on Windows.

### Step 2:  Register the sample with your Azure Active Directory tenant

There is one project in this sample. To register it, you can:

- either follow the steps [Step 2: Register the sample with your Azure Active Directory tenant](#step-2-register-the-sample-with-your-azure-active-directory-tenant) and [Step 3:  Configure the sample to use your Azure AD tenant](#choose-the-azure-ad-tenant-where-you-want-to-create-your-applications)
- or use PowerShell scripts that:
  - **automatically** creates the Azure AD applications and related objects (passwords, permissions, dependencies) for you
  - modify the Visual Studio projects' configuration files.

If you want to use this automation:
1. On Windows run PowerShell and navigate to the root of the cloned directory
1. In PowerShell run:
   ```PowerShell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process -Force
   ```
1. Run the script to create your Azure AD application and configure the code of the sample application accordingly. 
   ```PowerShell
   .\AppCreationScripts\Configure.ps1
   ```
   > Other ways of running the scripts are described in [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md)

1. Open the Visual Studio solution and click start

If you don't want to use this automation, follow the steps below

#### Choose the Azure AD tenant where you want to create your applications

As a first step you'll need to:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account or a personal Microsoft account.
1. If your account is present in more than one Azure AD tenant, select `Directory + Subscription` at the top right corner in the menu on top of the page, and switch your portal session to the desired Azure AD tenant.
1. In the left-hand navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service, and then select **App registrations**.

#### Register the client app (daemon-console)

1. Navigate to the Microsoft identity platform for developers [App registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) page.
1. Select **New registration**.
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `daemon-console`.
   - In the **Supported account types** section, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only ({tenant name})**.
   - Select **Register** to create the application.
1. On the app **Overview** page, find the **Application (client) ID** value and record it for later. You'll need it to configure the Visual Studio configuration file for this project.
1. From the **Certificates & secrets** page, in the **Client secrets** section, choose **New client secret**:

   - Type a key description (for instance `app secret`),
   - Select a key duration of either **In 1 year**, **In 2 years**, or **Never Expires**.
   - When you press the **Add** button, the key value will be displayed, copy, and save the value in a safe location.
   - You'll need this key later to configure the project in Visual Studio. This key value will not be displayed again, nor retrievable by any other means,
     so record it as soon as it is visible from the Azure portal.
1. In the list of pages for the app, select **API permissions**
   - Click the **Add a permission** button and then,
   - Ensure that the **Microsoft APIs** tab is selected
   - In the *Commonly used Microsoft APIs* section, click on **Microsoft Graph**
   - In the **Application permissions** section, ensure that the right permissions are checked: **User.Read.All**
   - Select the **Add permissions** button

1. At this stage permissions are assigned correctly but the client app does not allow interaction. 
   Therefore no consent can be presented via a UI and accepted to use the service app. 
   Click the **Grant/revoke admin consent for {tenant}** button, and then select **Yes** when you are asked if you want to grant consent for the
   requested permissions for all account in the tenant.
   You need to be an Azure AD tenant admin to do this.

### Step 3:  Configure the sample to use your Azure AD tenant

In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

Open the solution in Visual Studio to configure the projects

#### Configure the client project

> Note: if you used the setup scripts, the changes below will have been applied for you, with the exception of the national cloud specific steps.

1. Open the `daemon-console\appsettings.json` file.
1. If you are connecting to a national cloud, change the instance to the correct Azure AD endpoint. [See this reference for a list of Azure AD endpoints.](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/deployments#app-registration-and-token-service-root-endpoints)
1. Find the app key `Tenant` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant name.
1. Find the app key `ClientId` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of the `daemon-console` application copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the app key `ClientSecret` and replace the existing value with the key you saved during the creation of the `daemon-console` app, in the Azure portal.
1. If you are connecting to a national cloud, open the 'daemon-console\Program.cs' file.
1. Change the graph endpoint on lines in which there is a "graph.microsoft.com" reference. [See this reference for more info on which graph endpoint to use.](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/deployments#microsoft-graph-and-graph-explorer-service-root-endpoints)

### Step 4: Run the sample

Clean the solution, rebuild the solution, and run it.  You might want to go into the solution properties and set both projects as startup projects, with the service project starting first.

Start the application, it will display the users in the tenant.

## About the code

The relevant code for this sample is in the `Program.cs` file, in the `RunAsync()` method. The steps are:

1. Create the MSAL confidential client application.

    Important note: even if we are building a console application, it is a daemon, and therefore a confidential client application, as it does not
    access Web APIs on behalf of a user, but on its own application behalf.

    ```CSharp
    IConfidentialClientApplication app;
    app = ConfidentialClientApplicationBuilder.Create(config.ClientId)
                                              .WithClientSecret(config.ClientSecret)
                                              .WithAuthority(new Uri(config.Authority))
                                              .Build();
    ```

2. Define the scopes.

   Specific to client credentials, you don't specify, in the code, the individual scopes you want to access. You have statically declared
   them during the application registration step. Therefore the only possible scope is "resource/.default" (here "https://graph.microsoft.com/.default")
   which means "the static permissions defined in the application"

    ```CSharp
    // With client credentials flows the scopes is ALWAYS of the shape "resource/.default", as the 
    // application permissions need to be set statically (in the portal or by PowerShell), and then granted by
    // a tenant administrator
    string[] scopes = new string[] { "https://graph.microsoft.com/.default" };
    ```

3. Acquire the token

    ```CSharp
    AuthenticationResult result = null;
    try
    {
        result = await app.AcquireTokenForClient(scopes)
                          .ExecuteAsync();
    }
    catch(MsalServiceException ex)
    {
        // AADSTS70011
        // Invalid scope. The scope has to be of the form "https://resourceurl/.default"
        // Mitigation: this is a dev issue. Change the scope to be as expected
    }
    ```

4. Call the API

    In that case calling "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users" with the access token as a bearer token.

## Troubleshooting

### Did you forget to provide admin consent? This is needed for daemon apps

If you get an error when calling the API `Insufficient privileges to complete the operation.`, this is because the tenant administrator has not granted permissions
to the application. See step 6 of [Register the client app (daemon-console)](#register-the-client-app-daemon-console) above.

You will typically see, on the output window, something like the following:

```Json
Failed to call the Web Api: Forbidden
Content: {
  "error": {
    "code": "Authorization_RequestDenied",
    "message": "Insufficient privileges to complete the operation.",
    "innerError": {
      "request-id": "<a guid>",
      "date": "<date>"
    }
  }
}
```

## Variation: daemon application using client credentials with certificates

Daemon applications can use two forms of secrets to authenticate themselves with Azure AD:

- **application secrets** (also named application password). This is what we've seen so far.
- **certificates**. This is the object of this paragraph.

![Topology](./ReadmeFiles/topology-certificates.png)

To use certificates instead of an application secret you will need to do little changes to what you have done so far:

- (optionally) generate a certificate and export it, if you don't have one already
- register the certificate with your application in the application registration portal
- enable the sample code to use certificates instead of app secret.

### (Optional) use the automation script

If you want to use the automation script:
1. On Windows run PowerShell and navigate to the root of the cloned directory
1. In PowerShell run:
   ```PowerShell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process -Force
   ```
1. Run the script to create your Azure AD application and configure the code of the sample application accordingly. 
   ```PowerShell
   .\AppCreationScripts-WtihCert\Configure.ps1
   ```
   > Other ways of running the scripts are described in [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts-WithCert/AppCreationScripts.md)


If you don't want to use this automation, follow the following steps:

### (Optional) Create a self-signed certificate

To complete this step, you will use the `New-SelfSignedCertificate` Powershell command. You can find more information about the New-SelfSignedCertificat command [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/pkiclient/new-selfsignedcertificate).

1. Open PowerShell and run New-SelfSignedCertificate with the following parameters to create a self-signed certificate in the user certificate store on your computer:

    ```PowerShell
    $cert=New-SelfSignedCertificate -Subject "CN=DaemonConsoleCert" -CertStoreLocation "Cert:\CurrentUser\My"  -KeyExportPolicy Exportable -KeySpec Signature
    ```

1. Export this certificate using the "Manage User Certificate" MMC snap-in accessible from the Windows Control Panel. You can also add other options to generate the certificate in a different
store such as the Computer or service store (See [How to: View Certificates with the MMC Snap-in](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-view-certificates-with-the-mmc-snap-in)).

Alternatively you can use an existing certificate if you have one (just be sure to record its name for the next steps)

### Add the certificate for the daemon-console application in Azure AD

In the application registration blade for your application, in the **Certificates & secrets** page, in the **Certificates** section:

1. Click on **Upload certificate** and, in click the browse button on the right to select the certificate you just exported (or your existing certificate)
1. Click **Add**

### Configure the Visual Studio project

To change the visual studio project to enable certificates you need to:

1. Open the `daemon-console\appsettings.json` file
1. Find the app key `CertificateName` and replace the existing value with the name of your certificate (if you generated your own certificate from the instructions above, this should be `CN=DaemonConsoleCert`).
1. If you had set `ClientSecret` previously, set its value to empty string, `""`.

#### Build and run

Build and run your project. You have the same output, but this time, your application is authenticated with Azure AD with the certificate instead of the application secret.

#### About the alternate code

The code change is the following: the `ClientCredentials` instance passed to the constructor of the `ConfidentialClientApplication` is now built from a `ClientAssertionCertificate` instance (built from the certificate) instead of from the application password

```CSharp
X509Certificate2 certificate = ReadCertificate(config.CertificateName);
app = ConfidentialClientApplicationBuilder.Create(config.ClientId)
                .WithCertificate(certificate)
                .WithAuthority(new Uri(config.Authority))
                .Build();
```

The rest of the application is the same. The sample also has a method to retrieve the certificate from the Windows certificate store (This part was not tested on linux)
