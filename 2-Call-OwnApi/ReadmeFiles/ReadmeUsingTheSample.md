To run this sample, you'll need:

- [Visual Studio](https://aka.ms/vsdownload) and the [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started)
- An Internet connection
- A Windows machine (necessary if you want to run the app on Windows)
- An OS X machine (necessary if you want to run the app on Mac)
- A Linux machine (necessary if you want to run the app on Linux)
- An Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant. For more information on how to get an Azure AD tenant, see [How to get an Azure AD tenant](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-howto-tenant/)

### Step 1:  Clone or download this repository

From your shell or command line:

```Shell
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnetcore-daemon-v2.git
```

or download and extract the repository .zip file.

> Given that the name of the sample is pretty long, and so are the name of the referenced NuGet packages, you might want to clone it in a folder close to the root of your hard drive, to avoid file size limitations on Windows.

Navigate to the `"2-Call-OwnApi"` folder

```Shell
cd "2-Call-OwnApi"
```

### Step 2:  Register the sample with your Azure Active Directory tenant

There is one project in this sample. To register it, you can:

- either follow the steps [Step 2: Register the sample with your Azure Active Directory tenant](#step-2-register-the-sample-with-your-azure-active-directory-tenant) and [Step 3:  Configure the sample to use your Azure AD tenant](#choose-the-azure-ad-tenant-where-you-want-to-create-your-applications)
- or use PowerShell scripts that:
  - **automatically** creates the Azure AD applications and related objects (passwords, permissions, dependencies) for you
  - modify the Visual Studio projects' configuration files.

If you want to use this automation:

1. On Windows run PowerShell and navigate to the root of the cloned directory
1. In PowerShell run:

   ```PowerShell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process -Force
   ```

1. Run the script to create your Azure AD application and configure the code of the sample application accordingly.

   ```PowerShell
   .\AppCreationScripts\Configure.ps1
   ```

   > Other ways of running the scripts are described in [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md)

1. Open the Visual Studio solution and click start

If you don't want to use this automation, follow the steps below

#### Choose the Azure AD tenant where you want to create your applications

As a first step you'll need to:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account or a personal Microsoft account.
1. If your account is present in more than one Azure AD tenant, select `Directory + Subscription` at the top right corner in the menu on top of the page, and switch your portal session to the desired Azure AD tenant.
1. In the left-hand navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service, and then select **App registrations**.

#### Register the service app (TodoList-webapi-daemon-v2)

1. Navigate to the Microsoft identity platform for developers [App registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) page.
1. Select **New registration**.
1. When the **Register an application page** appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `TodoList-webapi-daemon-v2`.
   - Leave **Supported account types** on the default setting of **Accounts in this organizational directory only**.
1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. On the app **Overview** page, find the **Application (client) ID** value and record it for later. You'll need it to configure the Visual Studio configuration file for this project.
1. Select the **Expose an API** section:
    - Use the 'Set' button to generate the default AppID URI in the form of `api://<web api client id>`
   > If your tenant went through [domain verification](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-configure-publisher-domain) and you have verified domains available, you can use an AppID URI in the form of `https://<yourdomain>` or `https://<yourdomain>/<myAPI name>`  as well.
   - Click **Save**
1. Select the **Manifest** section, and:
   - Edit the manifest by locating the `appRoles`.  The role definition is provided in the JSON code block below. Leave the `allowedMemberTypes` to **Application** only. Each role definition in this manifest must have a different valid **Guid** for the "id" property.
   - Save the manifest.

The content of `appRoles` should be the following (the `id` can be any unique **Guid**)

```Json
{
  ...
    "appRoles": [
    {
        "allowedMemberTypes": [
        	"Application"
        ],
        "description": "An application permissions that gives you read and write access for all to-do's",
        "displayName": "Todo.ReadWrite.All",
        "id": "2abb8697-1162-4459-92b7-235f0ff8743c",
        "isEnabled": true,
        "lang": null,
        "origin": "Application",
        "value": "Todo.ReadWrite.All"
    }
    ],
 ...
}
```

#### Register the client app (daemon-console)

1. Navigate to the Microsoft identity platform for developers [App registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) page.
1. Select **New registration**.
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `daemon-console-v2`.
   - In the **Supported account types** section, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only ({tenant name})**.
   - Select **Register** to create the application.
1. On the app **Overview** page, find the **Application (client) ID** value and record it for later. You'll need it to configure the Visual Studio configuration file for this project.
1. From the **Certificates & secrets** page, in the **Client secrets** section, choose **New client secret**:

   - Type a key description (of instance `app secret`),
   - Select a key duration of either **In 1 year**, **In 2 years**, or **Never Expires**.
   - When you press the **Add** button, the key value will be displayed, copy, and save the value in a safe location.
   - You'll need this key later to configure the project in Visual Studio. This key value will not be displayed again, nor retrievable by any other means,
     so record it as soon as it is visible from the Azure portal.
1. In the list of pages for the app, select **API permissions**
   - Click the **Add a permission** button and then,
   - Ensure that the **My APIs** tab is selected
   - Select the API created in the previous step, for example `TodoList-webapi-daemon-v2`
   - In the **Application permissions** section, ensure that the right permissions are checked: **DaemonAppRole**
   - Select the **Add permissions** button
1. At this stage permissions are assigned correctly but the client app does not allow interaction.
   Therefore no consent can be presented via a UI and accepted to use the service app.
   Click the **Grant/revoke admin consent for {tenant}** button, and then select **Yes** when you are asked if you want to grant consent for the
   requested permissions for all account in the tenant.
   You need to be an Azure AD tenant admin to do this.

### Step 3:  Configure the sample to use your Azure AD tenant

In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

Open the solution in Visual Studio to configure the projects

#### Configure the service project

> Note: if you used the setup scripts, the changes below will have been applied for you

1. Open the `TodoList-WebApi\appsettings.json` file
1. Find the app key `Domain` in the `AzureAd` section and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant name.
1. Find the app key `TenantId` in the `AzureAd` section and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant ID.
1. Find the app key `ClientId` in the `AzureAd` section and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of the `TodoList-webapi-daemon-v2` application copied from the Azure portal.

#### Configure the client project

1. Open the `Daemon-Console\appsettings.json` file
1. If you are connecting to a national cloud, change the instance to the correct Azure AD endpoint. [See this reference for a list of Azure AD endpoints.](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/deployments#app-registration-and-token-service-root-endpoints)
1. Find the app key `TenantId`  in the `AzureAd` section and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant name.
1. Find the app key `ClientId` in the `AzureAd` section and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of the `daemon-console-v2` application copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the app key `ClientSecret` in the `AzureAd` section and replace the existing value with the key you saved during the creation of the `daemon-console-v2` app, in the Azure portal.
1. Find the app key `BaseUrl` in the `DownStreamApi` section and set to `https://localhost:44372/`
1. Find the app key `Scopes` in the `DownStreamApi` section and replace the existing value with the **App ID URI** of your web API, followed by "/.default".  

### Step 4: Run the sample

In the console run the API first

```Console
cd TodoList-WebApi
dotnet run
```

In a separate console, start the client app

```Console
cd daemon-console
dotnet run
```

Once the client app is started, it will display the ToDos from the API.
