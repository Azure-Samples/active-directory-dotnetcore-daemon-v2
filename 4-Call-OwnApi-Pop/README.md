# IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ
# This sample corresponds to an implementation of PoP without server nonce that is no longer recommended. If you start new projects donâ€™t use this sample. The recommended approach will be documented in the future.

Please use the sample [A \.NET Core daemon console application calling a protected Web API with its own identity](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnetcore-daemon-v2/tree/master/2-Call-OwnApi) to address the authentication flow supported by this sample
